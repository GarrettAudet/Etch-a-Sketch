Etch a Sketch

This project is an interactive web-based sketchpad, similar to an Etch-A-Sketch, designed to enhance DOM manipulation skills using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The sketchpad allows users to draw pixelated images using a grid of squares that change color as the user hovers over them with the mouse. This tool encourages learning through building, leveraging web development fundamentals to create an engaging user interface.
